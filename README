# Fedora SteamVR Setup
This script sets configures Fedora Linux and installs Steam so that SteamVR works. This was tested on my personal setup using an AMD 7900XTX and a Quest Pro using SteamLink. This should work for all headsets, however, I don't have an NVidia GPU to test this on. Getting NVidia to work should just be a matter of installing the proprietary nvidia drivers and the nvenc codecs. More information can be found here: https://rpmfusion.org/Howto/Multimedia If you'd like to test and add this, please feel free to open a PR.

## Instructions
Download and Run `fedorasteamvrsetup.sh` as root

`sudo ./fedorasteamvrsetup.sh`

The script will walk you through the rest. You can run the script as many times as you want. If there's an update and things break, you should be able to run the script again.

## What this script does not do
This does not install Proton RSTP so media players in VRChat work. Instructions on how to do that can be found here: https://github.com/SpookySkeletons/proton-ge-rtsp?tab=readme-ov-file#installation

This does not install other quality of life tools such as Full Body or Face and Eye tracking tools.

This does not install other streaming tools such as ALVR or WiVRn.
